  # Fix RLS Policies for Proper Authentication

  1. Changes
    - Update RLS policies to work with both authenticated and anon users
    - Ensure persons table policies allow data access with proper user_id filtering
    - Make policies less restrictive for development while maintaining security

  2. Security
    - All data still isolated by user_id
    - Users can only access their own data
